By providing us your Information or by making use of the facilities provided by the Website, You hereby consent to the collection, storage, processing and transfer of any or all of Your Personal Information and Non-Personal Information by us as specified under this Privacy Policy. You further agree that such collection, use, storage and transfer of Your Information shall not cause any loss or wrongful gain to you or any other person.

            <p>Such information will not be considered as sensitive if it is freely available and accessible in the public domain or is furnished under the Right to Information Act, 2005 or any other law for the time being in force.</p>

Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply (an example of this is when you ask for our Personalised Horoscope). A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign their own cookies to your browser (if you click on their ads), a process that we do not control.</p>

            <p>Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our site. (Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify you personally. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our site to the interests of our users, to measure traffic within our site and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where our visitors come.

We shall in no way be responsible in way for your use of such sites.5.  INFORMATION SHARING We shares the sensitive personal information to any third party without obtaining the prior consent of the user in the following limited circumstances:</p>

            <p>(a)&#160;When it is requested or required by law or by any court or governmental agency or authority to disclose, for the purpose of verification of identity, or for the prevention, detection, investigation including cyber incidents, or for prosecution and punishment of offences. These disclosures are made in good faith and belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary for enforcing these Terms; for complying with the applicable laws and regulations.</p>

            <p>(b)&#160;We proposes to share such information within its group companies and officers and employees of such group companies for the purpose of processing personal information on its behalf. We also ensure that these recipients of such information agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>

            <p>INFORMATION SECURITY We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.</p>

            <p>All information gathered on our Website is securely stored within our controlled database. The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited. However, as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a posting to the discussion areas is available to anyone with Internet access.&#160;</p>

            <p>However the internet is an ever evolving medium. We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time to incorporate necessary future changes. Of course, our use of any information we gather will always be consistent with the policy under which the information was collected, regardless of what the new policy may be.</p>

The max charge for a single trip is Rs.700 for 12 hours according to our per ride Charges as mentioned on the Website & the App.
            Maximum Rental Time and Charges:  Maximum rental time is 12 hours.  Rider agrees that Rider will deactivate the Bicycle rental within 12 hours of time that rental of the Bicycle began.  The rider may then rent again.  Rider agrees that he/she is solely responsible for being aware of any elapsed time related to the timely locking the Bicycle.  The maximum day charge is Rs.700 and is based on a calendar day.  After the return of the Bicycle, the rider will be charged the accumulated rental charges, or the maximum day charge; whichever is less.

            • Rider is fully aware that riding a bicycle on streets poses a risk of accident due to motorists, pedestrians, and road conditions, and rider must keep a proper lookout to avoid such accidents. Dhannoo won’t be responsible for any such incident as rider’s safety while riding bicycle will be their own responsibility. In the event that a rider gets into an accident with a third party while riding Dhannoo bicycle, third party implication will be rider’s responsibility as Dhannoo is just providing a bicycle service. We prescribe riders to ride safely and responsibly.

            • Rider is solely responsible for operating and riding a Bicycle in a careful and reasonably competent manner.

            • All Bicycles are and shall remain the exclusive property of Dhannoo at all times.
            • Rider is solely responsible for any traffic violations and/or fines incurred by Rider while using the Bicycle, including any fees for parking the Bicycle in prohibited locations as accordance with the Laws of the Country in operation.
            • Dhannoo is not obligated to provide insurance of any kind related to Rider or Rider’s use of the Bicycle, and in the event that Dhannoo, at its option, carries insurance, Rider shall remain liable for any liability, property damage, personal injury, injury to others, damages, penalties, fines, losses, and/or expenses of any kind whatsoever.
            • If Rider causes damage to property or injury to another party while operating or in possession of the Bicycle, Rider is solely liable for such damage or injury.
            • The rider shall return the Bicycle to Dhannoo in the same condition as when received.
            • Rider is liable for any and all damages resulting from improper use or abuse of the Bicycle and the cost of such damages.
