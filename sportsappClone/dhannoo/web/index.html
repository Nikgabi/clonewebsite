            </p>
            <h2>Purpose and Usage</h2>
            <p>To avail certain Amusement Facilities on the Portal, Users would be required to provide certain information for the registration process namely:<br>
            1. Username <br>
            2. Password <br>

            In the course of providing the Amusement Facilities, Users may invite other existing Users or other users (“Invited Users”) to participate in any of the Amusement Facilities by providing the email address or Facebook username of such users. Dibster may thereafter use this information to contact the Invited User and invite such user to register with Dibster (if such Invited User is not a existing User) and participate in the Game/Amusement Facility in relation to which such person was invited by the User. The participation of the Invited User in any of the Amusement Facilities shall be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions for the use of the Portal. The User hereby represents that the Invited Users have consented and agreed to such disclosure to and use of their email address and Facebook username by Dibster.
            All required information is specific and based on the kind of Game/ Amusement Facility the User wishes to participate in or access, and will be utilized for the purpose of providing services, including but not limited to the Amusement Facility, requested by the User. The information as supplied by the Users enables us to improve the Amusement Facilities and provide you the most user-friendly game experience. Dibster may also share such information with affiliates and third parties in limited circumstances, including for the purpose of providing services requested by the User, complying with legal process, preventing fraud or imminent harm, and ensuring the security of our network and services.
            </p>
            <h2>Disclosure/Sharing</h2>
            <p>Dibster may also share information as provided by you and data concerning usage of the Amusement Facility and participation in the Games with third party service providers engaged by Dibster, for the purpose of data analytics or other similar purposes, for the purpose of storage, improving the services and helping Dibster serve you better.
            Where we propose to use your personal information (that is, information that that may be used to identify the User and that is not otherwise publicly available) for any other uses we will ensure that we notify you first. You will also be given the opportunity to withhold or withdraw your consent for your use other than as listed above.
            By using the Portal, you hereby expressly agree and grant consent to the collection, use and storage of this information by Dibster. Dibster reserves the right to share, disclose and transfer information collected hereunder with its own affiliates. In the event Dibster sells or transfers all or a portion of its business assets, consumer information may be one of the business assets that are shared, disclosed or transferred as part of the transaction. You hereby expressly grant consent and permission to Dibster for disclosure and transfer of information to such third parties. Further, Dibster reserves the right to disclose personal information as obligated by law, in response to duly authorized legal process, governmental requests and as necessary to protect the rights and interests of Dibster.
            </p>
            <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
            <p>To improve the effectiveness and usability of the Portal for our Users, we use "cookies", or such similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique random number as a User Identification (User ID) to understand the User's individual interests using the identified computer. Unless the User voluntarily identifies himself/herself (e.g., through registration), Dibster has no way of knowing who the User is, even if we assign a cookie to the User's computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information supplied by the User. A cookie cannot read data off the User's hard drive. Dibster’s advertisers may also assign their own cookies to the User's browser (if the User clicks on their ad banners), a process that Dibster does not control.
            Dibster's web servers automatically collect limited information about User's computer's connection to the Internet, including User's IP address, when the User visits the Portal. (User's IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send data to the User -- such as the web pages viewed by the User). The User's IP address does not identify the User personally. Dibster uses this information to deliver its web pages to Users upon request, to tailor its Portal to the interests of its users, to measure traffic within the Portal and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where Dibster's visitors come
            </p>
            <h2>Links</h2>
            <p>Dibster also includes links to other websites. Such websites are governed by their respective privacy policies, which are beyond Dibster's control.
